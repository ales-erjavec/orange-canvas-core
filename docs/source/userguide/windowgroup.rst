Saved Window Groups
-------------------

A preset widget window groups can be saved in a workflow for switching
between views of selected nodes.

Open and arrange on the desktop the widgets you wish to save as a preset in
the workflow.

From the menu bar open :guilabel:`View` -> :guilabel:`Window Groups`
-> :guilabel:`Save Window Group...`. You will be presented with a dialog where
you can give the group a meaningful name. Additionally the group can be
set as the *default* group. This group is automatically activated when a
workflow is opened.

Once the group is saved it can be activated from the :guilabel:`View`
-> :guilabel:`Window Groups` menu.

.. note::
   The groups can be activated with a shortcut sequence
   :kbd:`Win+P, Ctrl+NUM` (:kbd:`Ctrl+P, Command+NUM` on Mac) where `NUM`
   is the number of the group.

.. note::
   The window arrangements might not be exactly reconstructed on different
   systems and display screens.
